Job Name: C:\Users\admin\Documents\XpeditionPCB\workspace\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard.prj


     Packager     Version: 020806.00

        Commandline is: "C:\MentorGraphics\EEVX.2.2\SDD_HOME\wg\win32\bin\package "-uC:\Users\admin\Documents\XpeditionPCB\workspace\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard\Default\default.icdb" -k -CleanBuild "-jC:\Users\admin\Documents\XpeditionPCB\workspace\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard.prj" "

     The Common Database is at "C:\Users\admin\Documents\XpeditionPCB\workspace\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard\Default\default.icdb".

     The Root of this design is "Schematic1".

     The Front End Snapshot of this design is "DCDV".

     The PCB Design Path of this design is at "C:\Users\admin\Documents\XpeditionPCB\workspace\TP_STM32_Vincent_Gaillard\PCB\PCB.pcb".

     The Central Library is at "F:\Central_Libs\ENST.lmc".

     The Disable Repackage status indicates that 
      Repackaging should be allowed.

     A new Target PDB will be created from the Central Library to satisfy the parts
      requirements of the iCDB.

     The AllowAlphaRefDes status indicates that reference
      designators containing all alpha characters should be deleted
      and the relevant symbols repackaged.

     The cross mapping of symbol pin names to Part Number pin
      numbers will be checked for packaged symbols and mapped correctly
      for unpackaged symbols.

     Properties that have been checked off in the Property Definition Editor
      found at Library Manager/Common Properties will be checked for value
      differences between the PartsDB and the non-null properties on symbols.
     Those properties checked off will be transferred from the PartsDB to all
      symbols, both packaged and unpackaged.  However, the property values
      transferred will be limited to the precision specified in the Notation
      Settings dialog.
     The following properties were checked off in the Property Definition Editor:
       "Parametric"
       "Value2"
       "Attachment"
       "Verification Statut"

    ERROR: Block Schematic1, Page 2, Symbol XCMP815:
      Inconsistent part data.
      Reference Designator C10 is on more than one symbol at
      Path Schematic1.  This one has a Part Number 10-0069, a Part Name CAPCERAM0603,
      and a Part Label CAP C0603 10pF NPO 10V while the other symbol

      Packaging is required to put symbols that have the same Reference Designator
      at the same path in the same package.  This cannot be accomplished unless
      the symbols have identical Part Numbers, or if both Part Numbers are missing,
      then identical Part Names or if they are missing, identical Part Labels.
      Please remove or change the Reference Designator or adjust the
      Part Number, Part Name, and or Part Label of either symbol.
