# SE302

In this repository, all work produced during a lesson course called [SE302](https://sen.enst.fr/se302-architecture-des-systemes-embarques) (Embedded Systems) is stored.

### TP_STM32/

This is the main project of this course. The goal is to program a STM32E407 using ChibiOS in order to control GPIO, Serial over USB bus, Ethernet.  
Each step is detailed into TP_STM32/README.md
Here is the [wording](https://sen.enst.fr/se302a-se302b/tp-stm32/partie-logicielle) (french)

### Challenge2018/

This project is the following of the previous one. It's the examination test. Each student had 6h to complete all the project steps.  
Using our board (STM32E407), we used TCP/IP to get the [wording](https://rose.telecom-paristech.fr/2018/).  
We had to:
* Send a TCP/IP request
* Send two requests in a short delay, one depending on the other
* Send GET parameter to answer lesson questions
* Use a new item: LCD screen
* Get image to display from Internet requests
* Win against a maze using LCD screen, commands and data requests.
